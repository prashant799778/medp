               <br><br><strong> Welcome to the MEDPARLIAMENT, the Global Parliament \
               of Healthcare Leadership. </strong><br><br>Today, the nature of healthcare is very dynamic, global and interactive. This is era of <br>\
genomics, personalized medicine, hospitals with hospitality, artificial intelligence, <br>\
wearable devices and IoT. We at MedAchievers with our strong international<br>\
presence since 2014, including in India, Australia, USA, UK, Israel and Singapore<br>\
have mastered the art of transactions. We have found that transformation can be<br> \
achieved if done uniformly through discussions, idea sharing, strength transfer and<br>\
frugal innovations. Conferences and summits are not enough, we need a strong <br>\
platform that will address the pathways to create quality and affordable <br>\
healthcare with entrepreneurs in a selected gathering of leaders with complementary<br>\
skills. MedParliament is the launch of interactive platform that<br>\
facilitates the globalization and transformation of healthcare.<br><br>\
<strong>The Intention</strong><br>\
<br>What it means to be a healthcare practitioner in 2020 is vastly different<br>\
to what it will be in 2025, let alone to how it was in 2010.<br>\
Training and skilling opportunities for healthcare professionals <br>\
must evolve and should allow them to get exposed to needed technology<br>\
and apply the same in their practice. Moreover, the support for those <br>\
already in the medical sciences as business owners, policy makers, academics<br>\
and employees must become more robust. MedParliament is the coming together <br>\
of our industry to achieve that end. <br>\
<strong>The Process</strong><br><br>\
MedParliament addresses each of the critical areas associated with medical sciences,<br>\
 healthcare practice and management. With emerging trends highlighted, new opportunities<br>\
 presented and practical information passed on from the leaders shaping healthcare in <br>\
India and around the world, Medparliament is the premier platform for collaboration.<br>\
Our Medparliamentarians include healthcare professionals, clinicians, senior management <br>\
of businesses related to healthcare, education organisations, funds, investors, government<br>\
and start-ups with innovative ideas in healthcare.<br><br>\
Parliament is the place where policies, solutions, standard protocols and <br>\
common model of work is created after consulting leaders from different domain<br>\
and geography. Similarly, “MedParliament" was launched as global Parliament <br>\
of Healthcare Business at The Leela Palace, Delhi in July 2019. In 2020 MedParliament<br>\
has become truly global. Top minds and leaders are gathering through the platform to <br>\
draw common solutions and methods for improved healthcare delivery, more fruitful <br>\
transactions and enhanced skilling opportunities. A glittery constellation of Ministers, <br>\
Diplomats, Healthcare CEOs, Research and tech titans, venture capitalists from different <br>\
parts of the globe are now sharing deeper ways of collaboration and Transaction.<br>\
<strong>WHAT DO WE HAVE FOR YOU?</strong><br><br>\
We look forward to your views and insights on the healthcare industry and all of the<br> \
industries which intersect with it. Do take the time to browse our app for the latest <br>\
healthcare news and dedicated healthcare related content including videos and events.<br>\
